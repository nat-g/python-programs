"""
We have a list of integers, where:

The integers are in the range 1..n1..n
The list has a length of n+1n+1
It follows that our list has at least one integer which appears at least
 twice. But it may have several duplicates, and each duplicate may appear
 more than twice.

Write a function which finds an integer that appears more than once in 
our list. (If there are multiple duplicates, you only need to find one 
of them.)

We're going to run this function on our new, super-hip Macbook Pro 
With Retina Displayâ„¢. Thing is, the damn thing came with the RAM 
soldered right to the motherboard, so we can't upgrade our RAM. 
So we need to optimize for space!

"""
One way to beat O(n^2) time is to get O(nlgn) time. 
Sorting takes O(nlgn) time. And if we sorted the list, 
any duplicates would be right next to each-other!
But if we start off by sorting our list we'll need to take O(n) space 
to store the sorted list..unless we sort the input list in place.
Steps:
-Do an in-place sort of the list (for example an in-place mergesort).
-Walk through the now-sorted list from left to right.
-Return as soon as we find two adjacent numbers which are the same.
This'll keep us at O(1) space and bring us down to O(nlgn) time.
